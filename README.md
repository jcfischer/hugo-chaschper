# Chaschper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper)

## History 

[Chaschper](https://github.com/jcfischer/hugo-chascher) is based on [Casper Two](https://github.com/eueung/hugo-casper-two), a port of the [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), the default personal blogging theme for Ghost. A legacy version (v1.x) has [already been ported](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper) to Hugo years ago.

I simplified aspects of the Casper theme (removed the two different single page styles, cleaned up
partials and tried to organize things in a way that suited me better).

In addition, Chaschper features additional features:

* [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) integration
* [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.org) integration
* [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) integration
* Optional [Matomo](https://matomo.org) analytics (see installation instructions)
* Image Galleries (see `content/galleries`)
* Responsive images using the `{{< figure >}}` shortcut (this replaces the regular
  Hugo figure shortcut)


## Theme Demo

- [invisible.ch](https://invisible.ch/)

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper.git chaschper
    
or if you plan to use [netlify](https://netlify.com) to host your site

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### Matomo setup

If you want to use Matomo, install the Matomo theme:

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/holehan/hugo-components-matomo.git themes/matomo

## Sample Configuration

### Search

This theme has a search function. It uses [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for a site
specific search (be sure to set the `domain` in `config.toml`)

To get DuckDuckGo to index your domain, submit it to the 
[Yandex Webmaster Tools](https://webmaster.yandex.com) -
after a few days, DuckDuckGo will have picked up the domain and the pages indexed by Yandex.

## Image Galleries

Create a directory called "galleries" in your `content` directory. Add a directory for each 
gallery and place the images in it. Add `index.md` (otherwise it will not work) with a
description (optional) and the following front matter:

    ---
    title: "Scuol 2018-10-25"
    date: 2018-10-25T15:26:46+01:00
    tags: ["scuol", "autumn"]
    type: "gallery"
    ---
    
    A wonderful, sunny day in Scuol in autumn. Pictures taken during a walk down to the Inn river.

The galleries will mix in with your regular posts and there is
a `/galleries` path that lists all of them in reverse chronological order.

Uses [Fluidbox](https://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/demo/index.html) to display images.
